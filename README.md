# Introduction

Implementing chess in Python using PyGame, including a playable AI that uses NegaMax with Alpha Beta Pruning. The AI engine can be played on two modes: easy or hard, and uses either depth 1 or 3 respectively. Depth 4+ isn't practical as of now because it would be too slow. However, improvements in the engine can make it possible (eg. implementing move ordering in the AI, using numpy arrays instead of lists, etc). This project was inspired by Eddie Sharick's Youtube series
